title: "Palindrome Number"
---

Write a Python function `palindrome_with_twist(num)` that takes an integer `num` (where `0 <= num <= 10^6`) as input and returns `True` if the number is a palindrome with a twist. Otherwise, return `False`.

A number is a palindrome with a twist if:

1. The number itself is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
2. The sum of the digits of the number is also a palindrome.

If the input is `0`, return `True`.

<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `121` <br />
Output: `True` <br />
Explanation:
    - The number `121` is a palindrome.
    - The sum of the digits is `1 + 2 + 1 = 4`, which is also a palindrome.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `12321` <br />
Output: `False` <br />
Explanation:
- The number `12321` is a palindrome.
- The sum of its digits is `1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 9`, which is a palindrome.
- However, the twist condition is not satisfied because the sum of the digits (`9`) is not a multi-digit palindrome.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `11` <br />
Output: `True` <br />
Explanation:
- `11` is a palindrome.
- The sum of its digits is `1 + 1 = 2`, which is a palindrome.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `123` <br />
Output: `False` <br />
Explanation:
- `123` is not a palindrome.
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `0` <br />
Output: `True` <br />
Explanation:
- `0` is a palindrome, and the sum of its digits is `0`, which is also a palindrome.
</Callout>


## Instructions

1. Implement the function `palindrome_with_twist(num)` in the file `solution.py`.
2. Do not use any external libraries or advanced Python features (e.g., list comprehensions, lambda functions, etc.).
3. Use only the following Python concepts:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Conditionals
   - Loops
   - Type Casting
4. Test your solution by running `test.py`. The script will automatically check your implementation against 10 test cases.

## Hints

1. Break the problem into smaller parts:
    - Check if the number is a palindrome.
    - Calculate the sum of the digits of the number.
    - Check if the sum of the digits is a palindrome.
2. Use loops to reverse the number and calculate the sum of its digits.
3. Use conditionals to handle edge cases, such as `0` and single-digit numbers.
4. Pay attention to the twist condition: the sum of the digits must also be a palindrome.

## Solution

```python title="solution.py"
def palindrome_with_twist(num):
    # Remove the pass statement and write your code here!
    pass
```
