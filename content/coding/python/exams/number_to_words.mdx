title: "Number to Words"
---


Write a Python `function number_to_words(num)` that takes an integer `num` (where `0 <= num <= 9999`) as input and returns the English words representation of the number. The function should return the words in the following format:

- For numbers less than 20, return the word directly (e.g., `5` â†’ `"five"`).
- For numbers between 20 and 99, return the word in the format `"twenty-five"`.
- For numbers between 100 and 999, return the word in the format `"one hundred twenty-five"`.
- For numbers between 1000 and 9999, return the word in the format `"one thousand two hundred thirty-four"`.

If the input number is `0`, return `"zero"`.

<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `123` <br />
Output: `"one hundred twenty-three"`
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `1000` <br />
Output: `"one thousand"`
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `9999` <br />
Output: `"nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine"`
</Callout>

## Instructions

1. Implement the function `number_to_words(num)` in the file `solution.py`.
2. Do not use any external libraries or advanced Python features (e.g., dictionaries, list comprehensions, etc.).
3. Use only the following Python concepts:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Conditionals
   - Loops
   - Type Casting
4. Test your solution by running `test.py`. The script will automatically check your implementation against 10 test cases.

## Hints

1. Break the problem into smaller parts:
    - Handle numbers less than 20.
    - Handle numbers between 20 and 99.
    - Handle numbers between 100 and 999.
    - Handle numbers between 1000 and 9999.
2. Use conditionals to determine the range of the number.
3. Use loops and type casting to extract digits and construct the word representation.
4. Pay attention to edge cases, such as `0` and numbers with trailing zeros (e.g., `100`, `1000`).

## Solution

```python title="solution.py"
def number_to_words(num):
    # Remove the pass statement and write your code here!
    pass
```
