title: "Second Largest Number"
---

## Problem Statement

Write a Python function `find_second_largest(numbers)` that takes a list of integers `numbers` as input and returns the second largest number in the list. If the list has fewer than two unique numbers, return `None`.

<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `[3, 7, 2, 9, 5]` <br />
Output: `7` (because `9` is the largest and `7` is the second largest)
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `[-1, -5, -3, -2]` <br />
Output: `-2` (because `-1` is the largest and `-2` is the second largest)
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `[5, 5, 5, 5]` <br />
Output: `None` (because there are no two unique numbers)
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `[10]` <br />
Output: `None` (because there is only one number)
</Callout>

## Instructions

1. Implement the function `find_second_largest(numbers)` in the file `solution.py`.
2. Do not use any external libraries or advanced Python features (e.g., built-in functions like `sorted()`, `set()`, etc.).
3. Use only the following Python concepts:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Conditionals
   - Loops
   - Type Casting
4. Test your solution by running `test.py`. The script will automatically check your implementation against 10 test cases.

## Hints

1. Initialize two variables to store the largest and second largest numbers.
2. Loop through each number in the list and update the largest and second largest numbers accordingly.
3. Handle edge cases where the list has fewer than two unique numbers.


## Solution

```python title="solution.py"
def find_second_largest(numbers):
    # Check if the list has fewer than two numbers
    if len(numbers) < 2:
        return None

    # Initialize largest and second largest numbers
    largest = float("-inf")
    second_largest = float("-inf")

    # Loop through each number and update largest and second largest
    for num in numbers:
        # Update largest if num is greater than the current largest
        if num > largest:
            second_largest = largest
            largest = num
        # Update second_largest if num is greater than the current second_largest but not equal to largest
        elif num > second_largest and num != largest:
            second_largest = num

    # If second_largest is still -inf, it means there are no two unique numbers
    if second_largest == float("-inf"):
        return None

    return second_largest
```
