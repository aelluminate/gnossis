title: Variables and Data Types
---

In Python, a variable is a name that refers to a value. Variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated in a program. Python is dynamically typed, meaning you do not need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.

# Creating Variables

To create a variable, you simply assign a value to a name using the `=` operator.

```python
x = 5          # Integer
y = 3.14       # Float
name = "Alice" # String
is_student = True # Boolean
```

In the example above, we have created four variables: `x`, `y`, `name`, and `is_student`. The variables store an integer, a float, a string, and a boolean value, respectively

# Naming Conventions

When naming variables, you should follow these conventions:

- Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (`_`).
- The rest of the variable name may consist of letters, numbers (0-9), and underscores.
- Variable names are case-sensitive (`name`, `Name`, and `NAME` are three different variables).
- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.
- Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable names such as `print`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, and etc.

Examples of valid variable names:

```python
my_variable = 42
name = "Alice"
is_student = True
_age = 25
```

Examples of invalid variable names:

```python
2nd_number = 10  # Variable name cannot start with a number
my-variable = 3.14  # Variable name cannot contain hyphens
```

## Data Types

Python has several built-in data types that are used to represent different kinds of data. The most common data types include:

### Numeric Types

- **int**: Integer values such as `42`, `-10`, `0`.
- **float**: Floating-point values such as `3.14`, `-0.001`, `2.0`.
- **complex**: Complex numbers such as `3 + 4j`, `1 - 2j`.

### Text Type

- **str**: String values such as `"Hello"`, `"Python"`, `"42"`.

NOTE: Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single, or double quotes.

### Boolean Type

- **bool**: Boolean values `True` and `False`.

### Sequence Types

- **list**: Ordered, mutable collection of items.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```

- **tuple**: Ordered, immutable collection of items.

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
```

- **range**: Sequence of numbers.

```python
numbers = range(5) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Mapping Type

- **dict**: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.

```python
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
```

## Type Conversion

You can convert between different data types using type conversion functions such as `int()`, `float()`, `str()`, `list()`, `tuple()`, and `dict()`.

```python
# Convert string to integer
num_str = "10"
num_int = int(num_str)  # num_int is now 10

# Convert integer to string
num = 5
num_str = str(num)  # num_str is now "5"
```

### Checking Data Types

You can check the data type of a variable using the `type()` function.

```python
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

y = 3.14
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>

name = "Alice"
print(type(name))  # Output: <class 'str'>

is_student = True
print(type(is_student))  # Output: <class 'bool'>
```
