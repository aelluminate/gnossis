title: Conditionals
---

Conditionals are statements that allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false. They are fundamental for controlling the flow of a program.

## `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code only if a condition is true.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")


# Output: You are an adult.
```

## `if`-`else` Statement

The `if`-`else` statement is used to execute one block of code if the condition is true, and another block if the condition is false.

```python
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not an adult.")

# Output: You are not an adult.
```

## `if`-`elif`-`else` Statement

The `if`-`elif`-`else` statement is used to execute one block of code if the first condition is true, another block if the first condition is false and the second condition is true, and another block if all conditions are false.

```python
age = 16
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
elif age >= 13:
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")

# Output: You are a teenager.
```

## Nested `if` Statements

You can nest `if` statements inside other `if` statements.

```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        print("Positive and even.")
    else:
        print("Positive and odd.")
else:
    print("Negative or zero.")

# Output: Positive and even.
```

## Short-Hand `if` Statement

You can write an `if` statement on one line if it has only one statement.

```python
age = 18
if age >= 18: print("You are an adult.")

# Output: You are an adult.
```

## Short-Hand `if`-`else` Statement

You can write an `if`-`else` statement on one line.

```python
age = 16
print("You are an adult.") if age >= 18 else print("You are not an adult.")

# Output: You are not an adult.
```

## Short-Hand `if`-`elif`-`else` Statement

You can write an `if`-`elif`-`else` statement on one line.

```python
age = 16
print("You are an adult.") if age >= 18 else print("You are a teenager.") if age >= 13 else print("You are a child.")

# Output: You are a teenager.
```

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.

- `and`: Returns `True` if both statements are true.

```python
age = 20
is_student = True

if age >= 18 and is_student:
    print("You are eligible for a student discount.")

# Output: You are eligible for a student discount.
```

- `or`: Returns `True` if one of the statements is true.

```python
age = 20
is_student = True

if age < 18 or is_student:
    print("You are eligible for a student discount.")

# Output: You are eligible for a student discount.
```

- `not`: Reverse the result, returns `False` if the result is true.

```python
age = 20
is_student = True

if not age >= 18:
    print("You are not an adult.")

# Output: You are not an adult.
```
