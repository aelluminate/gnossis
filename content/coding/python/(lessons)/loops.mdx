title: Loops
---

Loops are used in programming to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition is true. Python has two main types of loops: `for` loops and `while` loops.

## `for` Loop

The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, string) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

``` 
```plaintext
apple 
banana 
cherry
``` 

Using `range()` with `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

```
```plaintext
0
1
2
3
4
```

## `while` Loop

The `while` loop is used to repeat a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```python
i = 0

while i < 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

``` 
```plaintext
0
1
2
3
4
```

## `break` Statement

The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
    if fruit == "banana":
        break

```
```plaintext
apple
banana
```

## `continue` Statement

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    if fruit == "banana":
        continue
    print(fruit)
```
```
Output:
apple
cherry
```

## `else` Clause

The `else` clause is executed when the loop is finished, but not when the loop is terminated by a `break` statement.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
else:
    print("Finished!")
```
```plaintext
apple
banana
cherry
Finished!
```

## Nested Loops

You can use one or more loops inside another loop. This is called nested loops.

```python
for i in range(3):  # Outer loop
    for j in range(2):  # Inner loop
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
```
```plaintext
i: 0, j: 0
i: 0, j: 1
i: 1, j: 0
i: 1, j: 1
i: 2, j: 0
i: 2, j: 1
```
