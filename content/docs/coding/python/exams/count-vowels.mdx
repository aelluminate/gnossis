title: "Count Vowels"
---

## Problem Statement

Write a Python function `count_vowels(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the total number of vowels in the string. The vowels to consider are `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, and `u` (both lowercase and uppercase).

<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `'Hello, World!'` <br />
Output: `3` (because `e`, `o`, and `o` are vowels)
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `'Python Programming'` <br />
Output: `4` (because `o`, `o`, `a`, and `i` are vowels)
</Callout>
<Callout title="Example" type="info">
Input: `'AEIOU'` <br />
Output: `5` (all characters are vowels)
</Callout>

## Instructions

1. Implement the function `count_vowels(s)` in the file `solution.py`.
2. Do not use any external libraries or advanced Python features (e.g., list comprehensions, lambda functions, etc.).
3. Use only the following Python concepts:
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Conditionals
   - Loops
   - Type Casting
4. Test your solution by running `test.py`. The script will automatically check your implementation against 10 test cases.

## Hints

1. Loop through each character in the string.
2. Use a conditional statement to check if the character is a vowel (both lowercase and uppercase).
3. Use a counter variable to keep track of the number of vowels.

## Solution

```python title="solution.py"
def count_vowels(s):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    count = 0

    # Loop through each character in the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a vowel
        if char in vowels:
            count += 1

    return count
```
